# arduino-timing-study
Arduino code used to conduct a study of synchronized performance accuracy.

I learned C specifically to build this. Because I'm not a C programmer, really, there are all sorts of bad coding practices here (especially repetitive code blocks). But it did what it was supposed to do. I learned a lot about how to optimize code for the small amount of memory available on a microcontroller.
